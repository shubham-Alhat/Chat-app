## How to handles files upload

> “How does a file selected in the frontend even reach `req.file.path` in backend?”

Let’s break it down **step by step**, exactly how Express + Multer magically puts the file in `req.file`.

---

## 🧠 Think Like a Computer: What Happens Internally

### ✅ Step 1: User Selects File on Frontend

HTML or React:

```html
<input type="file" name="image" />
```

This file input lets the user select `cat.jpg` from their local computer.

---

### ✅ Step 2: FormData Sends File in Special Format

You **do not** send a file as JSON.

You wrap it in `FormData` like this:

```js
const formData = new FormData();
formData.append("image", selectedFile); // "image" is key name

await fetch("http://localhost:5000/api/upload", {
  method: "POST",
  body: formData,
});
```

📦 This sends a `multipart/form-data` request to the backend, which is designed to carry binary files like images, PDFs, etc.

---

### ✅ Step 3: Multer Catches the Incoming File

Now, in your backend route:

```js
import { upload } from "../middlewares/multer.js";

router.post("/upload", upload.single("image"), uploadImage);
```

This part:

```js
upload.single("image");
```

means:

> “Hey Multer, extract the file with fieldname `image` from the request, store it, and attach it to `req.file`.”

So Multer **intercepts the request**, parses the multipart data, and makes the file available as an object:

```js
req.file = {
  originalname: "cat.jpg",
  mimetype: "image/jpeg",
  filename: "cat.jpg",
  path: "public/temp/cat.jpg", // 👈 THIS IS WHAT YOU USE
  size: 121302,
};
```

That’s how `req.file.path` appears.

---

### ✅ Step 4: You Use `req.file.path` for Cloudinary or Other Processing

```js
import { v2 as cloudinary } from "cloudinary";

const result = await cloudinary.uploader.upload(req.file.path);
```

This uploads the file to Cloudinary and returns:

```js
{
  secure_url: "https://res.cloudinary.com/your-image.jpg";
}
```

You can now store that URL in MongoDB or send to frontend.

## 🧪 Quick Recap

| What You Do                 | What Happens                                   |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Use `<input type="file" />` | User picks a file                              |
| Append to `FormData`        | Prepares it as `multipart/form-data`           |
| POST to backend             | File is in request body                        |
| `upload.single("image")`    | Multer parses it, saves it, adds to `req.file` |
| You access `req.file.path`  | Actual path to local file on server            |

---

## 🧠 Final Tip

If you used `.memoryStorage()` instead of `.diskStorage()` in Multer:

- File won't be saved to disk
- You'll use `req.file.buffer` (raw data) instead of `req.file.path`
